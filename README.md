## Hi there 👋

I am Md. Zubayer Alam, currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computing and Information System (Major in AI in IoT). 

I am deeply passionate about AI-driven smart systems, IoT automation, and cybersecurity solutions.

With a strong foundation in programming, web development, and embedded systems, I aim to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and real-world IoT applications, creating impactful solutions for a smarter future.

I have got some pinned projects, but my favourite is IoT-Enabled Smart Home Automation
