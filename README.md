### Hi there 👋

I am Md. Zubayer Alam, currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computing and Information System (Major in AI in IoT). 

I am deeply passionate about AI-driven smart systems, IoT automation, and cybersecurity solutions.

With a strong foundation in programming, web development, and embedded systems, I aim to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and real-world IoT applications, creating impactful solutions for a smarter future.

I have got some pinned projects, but my favourite ones are [IoT-Enabled Smart Home Automation](https://github.com/jami-zubayer/IoT-Enabled-Smart-Home-Automation) and [Kingdom of Martial Arts Bangladesh](https://github.com/jami-zubayer/Kingdom-of-Martial-Arts-Bangladesh)
